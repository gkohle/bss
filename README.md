The Code is in the INDEX.HTML file

Change the name of the images to a number before uploading (use lowest number that is not in use) 
Upload pictures to the Support Folder (open support folder and click on three dots in upper right corner; drag and drop images; make sure that you commit to the changes)
Delete any unused images (click on image and then three dots in upper right corner; make sure you commit to the changes)
Rename images to lower numbers if necessary to avoid blanks in the number naming setup.  Click on image and then click on pencil (upper right corner) change name and commit to the changes.

Edit the code in INDEX.HTML (by clicking on pencil in upper right corner), the totalImages on line 20 should match the number of images (with numbers)  (remember to commit to the changes)

There is an extra "you.jpg" in the Support folder to play if image is having trouble or missing.

The Wall.html and Wall2.html was practice files to the code and not used for the display of the images.

The List of Images and numbers can be found on Google Sheets https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UWC4-5uXjXxs1fNxtUn4Ec7h9QWv5QBvSFUYja10f8E/edit?usp=sharing
