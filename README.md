The Code is in the INDEX.HTML file

Change the name of the images to a number before uploading (use lowest number that is not in use) 
Upload pictures to the Support Folder (open support folder and click on three dots in upper right corner; drag and drop images; make sure that you commit to the changes)
Delete any unused images (click on image and then three dots in upper right corner; make sure you commit to the changes)

Edit the code in INDEX.HTML, the ImageNumber on line    should match the number of images (with numbers)  (remember to commit to the changes)
